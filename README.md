# A collection of optIn scripts

These scripts allow you to optIn for certain tools/dependencies for your project

In order to use this tool you will need to install the following

+ jq: for working with json files in the command-line
+ curl: for making http requests from the command-line to download files

## Currently Supported Dependencies

+ ESLint
+ Tailwind Css
+ Tailwind Css with CRA

## How it works

Each script will ``npm install`` all the required packages for the specified tool.
After, it will grab a config from my configs repo for that specified dependency and copy it to the root of the project directory
Then it will perform any custom commands afterwards
Additionally, if the dependency is already installed in the project running the script will remove it
